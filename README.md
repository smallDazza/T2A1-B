## Question 1 Answer:
Two different types of sorting algorithms are:
1)  Selection Sort algorithm: the process for this algorithm is it assumes the first element in an array is the lowest of all the elements. It will then check all the other elements for any element lower then this assumed lowest element. If it finds another actual element lower than the assumed element, it swaps the position of the assumed for the actual lower element. If in the checking process it finds no other element lower than the assumed, it moves to compare and check the next element position. This process is repeated until all elements have been checked and sorted in the array. Example of selection sort in python code:

Efficiency / Performance: the time complexity / Big O notation of this alogorithm is O(n^2) because there are 2 nested loops. Each individual loop to select / compare an element in an array is O(n). Therefore these both calculate as O(n) * 0(n) which = O(n^2). This algorithm will work well with small data sets but not good with large data sets.

2)  Merge Sort:
